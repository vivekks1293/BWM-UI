Project: BunkWithMe
Purpose

    Student-Centric: The app addresses the critical issue of maintaining attendance above a mandatory threshold (e.g., 75%), which many institutions enforce to avoid fines or exam restrictions.
    Real-Time Updates: Allows students to log attendance after each class period, enabling proactive tracking.

Key Features

    Timetable Management:
        Customizable timetables where students can define their schedules, including subjects, class timings, and weekly structures.
        Easy editing and viewing of timetables.

    Attendance Tracking:
        Students can mark themselves as Present, Absent, or Bunked for every class.
        Real-time updates ensure accuracy and immediate awareness of attendance status.

    Analytics Dashboard:
        Summarizes attendance data by subject.
        Provides totals and percentages for Present and Absent classes.
        Alerts for subjects where attendance falls below the required threshold.

    User-Friendly Interface:
        A mobile-first design with features like sticky columns, scrollable tables, and modals for effortless navigation.
        Simple yet modern aesthetics that appeal to students.

    Flexibility:
        Quick updates for attendance after every class hour.
        Encourages students to stay within safe attendance limits without stress.

Why It Stands Out

    Practical for Students: Helps them avoid penalties and track attendance efficiently.
    Lightweight: A focused tool, free from unnecessary complexity, tailored for quick updates and ease of use.
    Encourages Accountability: Motivates students to monitor their attendance regularly, reducing risks of fines or exam bans.

Tech Stack

    Frontend: Angular with TypeScript for dynamic and interactive interfaces.
    Backend: Node.js with MySQL for a reliable and scalable server-side infrastructure.
    Styling: Bootstrap for responsive and visually appealing designs.
